                <h2>By Adi Robertson | Photography by James Bareham</h2>
                <p>One month ago, I tested a virtual reality headset called the HTC Vive Pre. The Pre was a development
                    kit created by gaming behemoth Valve and smartphone maker HTC, and it was one of the most exciting
                    new pieces of hardware I’ve had the pleasure of writing about — a device that offered full-body,
                    room-scale VR.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="padding-m color-secondary">
                <h2>Consumer release</h2>
                <p>The headset above is not the Vive Pre. It’s the final consumer edition Vive that’s coming out today,
                    although it looks almost identical — the branding is new, and the small focus rod on the bottom is
                    ridged instead of smooth, but I still sometimes worry I’m picking up the wrong set by accident.
                    What’s changed is the context. The Pre was an obviously unfinished device that never went on sale,
                    complete with software glitches and half-finished games. The Vive is a real piece of consumer
                    hardware that you can go online and pay $800 for right this minute. It’s coming out a week after the
                    Oculus Rift, a competing headset with impeccable polish but limited ambition. So expectations for
                    the Vive are high — and the headset both exceeds and falls short of them.</p>

            <div class="padding-m">
                <h2>Roomscale VR</h2>
                <p>Since its first prototype was announced in early 2015, the Vive has been very clearly a full VR
                    system, not just a headset. Besides its heavy black goggles, the system includes a pair of wireless
                    motion controllers shaped like cupholders on sticks, and two "lighthouse" towers that are placed at
                    opposite corners of a room, shooting fields of lasers for motion tracking. The Vive grew out of a
                    prototype at Valve, and while the remotes don’t look much like gaming hardware, they’re designed
                    like a slimmed-down, split-up version of the company’s more traditional Steam Controller. Each one
                    has a clicky front trigger, a pair of side bumpers that you can press by squeezing tightly, two top
                    buttons, and a smooth trackpad.</p>

            <div class="article-image controllers"></div>
            <div class="padding-m color-secondary">
                <h2>The controllers</h2>
                <p>The Steam Controller’s trackpad was originally meant to give PC gamers mouse-like precision on a
                    console-style controller, but on the Vive controllers, it could easily be replaced by an ordinary
                    d-pad for most of the experiences I’ve tried. The best argument for it is aesthetic: it’s the
                    trackpad that elevates the Vive controller design from fancy Wii Remote to something truly
                    futuristic; each pad a beautiful little circle that looks like a cyberpunk data chip or a pan of
                    expensive eyeshadow. And adding an interface element that’s foreign to almost everyone is a great
                    signal that the Vive isn’t just for people who know their way around a controller.</p>
